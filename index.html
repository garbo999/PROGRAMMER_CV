<a id="projects" class="anchor" href="#projects" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>PROJECTS</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/garbo999/TabCode">TabCode</a>: Given a Javascript library without a formal API, I analyzed the code and repackaged it with some examples that I created. The goal was to make it possible for inexperienced users to display lute tablature on the web.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.laclaveciniste.com/en">LaClaveciniste.Com</a>: I was given the design for a small site and rebuilt it using Rails and Bootstrap. The main task here was to take a design created on a Macbook and rebuild the HTML in a sensible way with Bootstrap. In terms of Rails, the highlight is the internationalization (I18n) with support for two languages (Estonian and English).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.radiogetaway.com/">Radiogetaway.Com</a>: I created the design and built this site using Rails and Bootstrap. The site uses the Devise and Omniauth gems and it is deployed on Heroku.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://ancient-hollows-2475.herokuapp.com/nounparents">Estonian Spidering Project</a>: As part of my studies of the Estonian language, the goal of this project was to develop a Ruby class that would spider the linguistic website <a href="http://www.filosoft.ee/gene_et/">http://www.filosoft.ee/gene_et/</a> and save the data on the local server. Environment: Ruby on Rails. Main focus: MECHANIZE and PG_SEARCH gems.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://garage48.org/blog/othe-winner-of-garage48-tip-will-disrupt-traffickers-by-scanning-online-ads">Garage48 project</a>: During this 48-hour startup weekend, I was the backend developer for the 1st place team. Working with a human trafficking expert from an NGO, we created an app that regularly spiders a website offering sexual services and allows his team to analyze the nature of the offered services. I have continued working on this project from time to time since September 2015.</p></li>
<li><p>TRB4: I partnered with a friend in a startup in the translation industry in San Francisco. We initially hired an external company to code our webservice (a search engine for existing translations), then I took over the programming duties and rebuilt and finished the site (now defunct) using PHP and Oracle.</p></li>
