I studied the code and repackaged  it with examples. The goal was to make it possible for inexperienced users to display lute tablature on the web.\r\n\r\n- [LaClaveciniste.Com][Link 3] -- I was given the design for a small site and rebuilt it using Rails and Bootstrap. The main task here was to take a design created on a Macbook and rebuild the HTML in a sensible way with Bootstrap. In terms of Rails, the highlight is the internationalization (I18n) with support for two languages (Estonian and English).\r\n\r\n- Radiogetaway.Com -- I created the design and built this site using Rails and Bootstrap. The site uses the Devise and Omniauth gems and it is deployed on Heroku.\r\n\r\n- Estonian Spidering Project (https://ancient-hollows-2475.herokuapp.com/nounparents) -- The goal of this work in progress was to develop a Ruby class that would spider the website http://www.filosoft.ee/gene_et/ and save the data on the local server. I am learning to use the MECHANIZE and PG_SEACH gems.\r\n\r\n- [Garage48 project][Link 2]: \r\n\r\n- TRB4 -- I partnered with a friend in a startup in the translation industry in San Francisco. We initially paid an external company to code our webservice (a search engine for existing translations), then I took over the programming duties and rebuilt and finished the site (now defunct) using PHP and Oracle.\r\n\r\n### EDUCATION\r\n\r\n- BS Electrical Engineering from North Carolina State University: My degree included several programming courses including data structures. I also taught labs for several semesters in which the students were required to write and debug programs to interface microcontrollers with various types of hardware. \r\n- \"Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Parts 1 and 2\" from Coursera (Stanford University)\r\n- \"Software as a Service, Parts 1 and 2\" from edX (University of California at Berkeley)\r\n- \"Learn HTML5 from W3C\" from edX (W3C)\r\n\r\n[Link 1]: https://github.com/garbo999/TabCode\r\n[Link 2]: http://garage48.org/blog/othe-winner-of-garage48-tip-will-disrupt-traffickers-by-scanning-online-ads\r\n[Link 3]: LaClaveciniste.Com\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
