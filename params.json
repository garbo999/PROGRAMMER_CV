The goal was to make it possible for inexperienced users to display lute tablature on the web.\r\n\r\n- [LaClaveciniste.Com][Link 3]: I was given the design for a small site and rebuilt it using Rails and Bootstrap. The main task here was to take a design created on a Macbook and rebuild the HTML in a sensible way with Bootstrap. In terms of Rails, the highlight is the internationalization (I18n) with support for two languages (Estonian and English).\r\n\r\n- [Radiogetaway.Com][Link 4]: I created the design and built this site using Rails and Bootstrap. The site uses the Devise and Omniauth gems and it is deployed on Heroku.\r\n\r\n- [Estonian Spidering Project][Link 5]: As part of my studies of the Estonian language, the goal of this project was to develop a Ruby class that would spider the linguistic website http://www.filosoft.ee/gene_et/ and save the data on the local server. Environment: Ruby on Rails. Main focus: MECHANIZE and PG_SEARCH gems.\r\n\r\n- [Garage48 project][Link 2]: During this 48-hour startup weekend, I was the backend developer for the 1st place team. Working with a human trafficking expert from an NGO, we created an app that regularly spiders a website offering sexual services and allows his team to analyze the nature of the offered services. I have continued working on this project from time to time since September 2015.\r\n\r\n- TRB4: I partnered with a friend in a startup in the translation industry in San Francisco. We initially hired an external company to code our webservice (a search engine for existing translations), then I took over the programming duties and rebuilt and finished the site (now defunct) using PHP and Oracle.\r\n\r\n### EDUCATION\r\n\r\n- BS Electrical Engineering from North Carolina State University: My degree included several programming courses such as data structures. I also worked for three semesters as a lab instructor in courses where the students wrote and  debugged programs for interfacing microcontrollers with various types of hardware. \r\n\r\n### RECENT ONLINE COURSES\r\n- \"Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Parts 1 and 2\" from Coursera (Stanford University)\r\n- \"Software as a Service, Parts 1 and 2\" from edX (University of California at Berkeley)\r\n- \"Learn HTML5 from W3C\" from edX (W3C) (an excellent overview of the latest HTML standard)\r\n- Multiple courses in Machine Learning from Coursera (Stanford and University of Washington)\r\n\r\n[Link 1]: https://github.com/garbo999/TabCode\r\n[Link 2]: http://garage48.org/blog/othe-winner-of-garage48-tip-will-disrupt-traffickers-by-scanning-online-ads\r\n[Link 3]: http://www.laclaveciniste.com/en\r\n[Link 4]: http://www.radiogetaway.com/\r\n[Link 5]: https://ancient-hollows-2475.herokuapp.com/nounparents",
